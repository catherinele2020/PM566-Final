# Catherine Le: PM 566 Final Project

This repository includes my PM 566 Final Project website and written report. This repository also includes a folder titled "Data" that contains the dataset I am working with. 

Here is the link to my website: https://catherinele2020.github.io/PM566-Final

A brief summary of my final project: 

The question I am exploring in this final project is "What is the correlation between physical activity levels (e.g., reported exercise frequency) and diet habits (e.g., daily consumption of vegetables)?" The intention of this final project is to further explore the stereotype that people who eat healthier also exercise often.

To answer this question, I used the data set "Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System" (BRFSS). BRFSS is an on-going, state-based telephone survey conducted by the CDC and state health departments. The data includes self-reported information on nutrition, behavioral risk factors, and physical activity levels for all 50 U.S. states.
