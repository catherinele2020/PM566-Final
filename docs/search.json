The graph is a scatter plot visualizing the association between the “percentage of adults engaging in no leisure time physical activity” and the “percentage of adults consuming vegetables less than one time daily.” Plotly allows us to hover and see the exact (x.y) value of each point. (The data_value_exercise is from the exercise survey data and the data_value_vegetable is from the vegetable consumption survey data).\n\nThe black line represents a linear regression trend. Its positive slope indicates a correlation, signifying a positive association between the two variables.\n\n\nWarning in RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(N, \"Set2\"): n too large, allowed maximum for palette Set2 is 8\nReturning the palette you asked for with that many colors\n\nWarning in RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(N, \"Set2\"): n too large, allowed maximum for palette Set2 is 8\nReturning the palette you asked for with that many colors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach point on the plot represents a combination of these two variables. The data was aggregated by YearStart (i.e., the year the survey was given) and LocationDesc (i.e., the state the survey was conducted in). To create a more concise plot, the data was averaged based on these groupings.\ndata was pulled from the BRFSS.

Each point on the plot represents a combination of these two variables for different observations.\n\nPoints: The blue points on the plot represent individual data points from the dataset, with the x-axis showing the percentage of adults engaging in no leisure-time physical activity, and the y-axis showing the percentage of adults consuming vegetables less than one time daily.\nTrend Line: The black line on the plot is a linear regression trend line (fitted using the method of least squares). It represents the overall trend or association between the two variables. In this case, a positive slope of the line suggests a positive correlation between the lack of physical activity and lower vegetable consumption.\nTitle: The title of the plot is “Association Between Physical Activity and Vegetable Consumption,” indicating that the graph is illustrating the relationship between these two health-related behaviors.\nAxes Labels: The x-axis is labeled “% of Adults Engaging in No Leisure-Time Physical Activity,” and the y-axis is labeled “% of Adults Consuming Vegetables &lt; One Time Daily,” providing context for the plotted data.\n\nThis graph provides a visual summary of how the percentage of adults engaging in no leisure-time physical activity relates to the percentage of adults consuming vegetables less frequently."
