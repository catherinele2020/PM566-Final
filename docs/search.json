BRFSS is an on-going, state-based telephone survey conducted by the CDC and state health departments. The data includes self-reported information on nutrition, behavioral risk factors, and physical activity levels for all 50 U.S. states.\nTo get the data ready for exploration, I checked for missing values and implausible values (i.e., percentages under 0 and over 100). I then wrangled the data by filtering the data for rows that contained the survey questions “percent of adults who engage in no leisure-time physical activity” and “percent of adults who report consuming vegetables less than one time daily.” To explore the data for any patterns, I created histograms and scatterplots.\nBy creating a scatter plot between the variables “percentage of adults engaging in no leisure time activity” and “percentage of adults consuming vegetables less than one time daily”, I found that there was a positive correlation between the two. You can explore my findings further in the interactive graphics down below.\n\n\nInteractive Figures"
